{"name":"Oh Johnny","tagline":"Make use of *duino right in your browser.","body":"### So what is it with this Johnny?\r\n**Oh Johnny** enables you to watch when sensors are being connected to your \\*duino board and what kind of signal they produce. **Oh Johnny** makes use of the **johnny-five** library to read sensor data which in turn relies upon a [Firmata prototcol]() implementation for [node.js]().\r\n\r\n### How to use it\r\nSince **Oh Johnny** connects the physical world with the digital, a server needs to be started on the machine to which the \\*duino is connected, before any browser client may read out and display its signals:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ node install # needed only once\r\n$ node server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, you may point your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and watch your Johnny in action. (This is where the project name starts to sound creepy*â€”Ed.*)\r\n\r\n### Current State\r\nRight now, **Oh Johnny** doesn't really read signals from your board, mainly because filtering out analog noises and detecting pin connects seems to be a project in itself. We decided to focus on signal display first, this is why your Johnny seems to be firing events on itself.\r\n\r\n### Help welcome!\r\nAnybody with a grasp of knowledge on electronics and/or node programming language is welcome to help with the analog noise/connection detection issues preventing this project from unleashing its full potential.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
